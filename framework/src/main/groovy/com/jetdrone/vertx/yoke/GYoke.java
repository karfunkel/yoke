/**
 * Yoke is a chain executor of middleware for Vert.x 2.x.
 * The goal of this library is not to provide a web application framework but
 * the backbone that helps the creation of web applications.
 *
 * Yoke works in a similar way to Connect middleware. Users start by declaring
 * which middleware components want to use and then start an http server either
 * managed by Yoke or provided by the user (say when you need https).
 *
 * Yoke has no extra dependencies than Vert.x itself so it is self contained.
